Cyberpunk Pong Wars
A neon-soaked reimagining of the classic Pong Wars game with a cyberpunk aesthetic. Watch as two balls battle for territory in an eternal struggle between NEON and SHADOW forces, complete with glowing trails and atmospheric effects.


Features

Cyberpunk Visual Design: Neon pink and electric cyan colors against dark backgrounds
Dynamic Trail Effects: Each ball leaves a glowing trail of light as it moves
Atmospheric Effects, and now we have particle effects on collision.

Real-time Territory Control: Watch as the battlefield shifts between the two forces
Smooth 60 FPS Animation: Optimized for fluid gameplay
Fully Self-Contained: Single HTML file with no external dependencies (except Google Fonts)

How It Works
Two balls bounce around the playing field, each representing a different faction:

NEON (Purple/Cyan): Controls the left side initially
SHADOW (Black/Pink): Controls the right side initially

When a ball hits a square controlled by the opposing team, it converts that square to its own color. The game tracks the score in real-time, showing the ongoing battle for dominance.
